# Frontend-by-Template App (Internal Developer Documentation)

This Django app provides a server-rendered, template-based frontend for the language learning platform. It is an alternative to the SPA (Vue) frontend, designed for rapid prototyping, SEO, and simple user flows.

## Main Features

- **Video Listing**: Lists all live videos for the currently configured language (German or Arabic), using a feature flag (`LANGUAGE_TO_LEARN` in settings or .env). Pagination is supported.
- **Video Detail**: Shows video details, YouTube embed, progress bar, and a "Start Practice" button.
- **Practice Flow**: Allows users to practice snippets (flashcards) for each video, one by one, using Alpine.js for interactivity.
- **Guest User Support**: All template views require a (guest) user session, using `django-guest-user` for seamless, registration-free tracking.
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks when a user last practiced a video and displays this info on the video list.
- **Bulma CSS**: Uses Bulma for styling and layout; Alpine.js for minimal interactivity.
- **Language Switch**: All video queries and UI elements adapt to the `LANGUAGE_TO_LEARN` feature flag.
