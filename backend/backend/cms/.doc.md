Content management system for me, the admin, to add and maintain youtube videos, words, meanings etc.

## State of things

- Vibe-coded a single view to try to go through the youtube videos of a given channel
  - not sure if it worked, because I exceeded daily youtube quota before doing anything useful with it
  - [link to the relevant view](http://127.0.0.1:8000/cms/channel-videos/?channel_id=DisneyInArabic)
  - should be something like: fetch 10 videos, skip everything w/o subtitles in the first place, let rate, then fetch next
    - in fact using youtube-subtitle-api I think we can circumvent these excessive hits by JUST asking for the videos, then just using that for free subtitle check
