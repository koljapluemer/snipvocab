    If you sign up for an account, we will save your email address and your password securely, on a protected server located in the EU.

    All of this is needed to track your learning progress and make Arabic with Videos work.

    This learning data (not email addresses) may be analyzed and published anonymously, in aggregate, to improve the app or for research and promotion purpose.

    We don't sell data, and we don't use it outside the context of this app.

    Note that this app uses YouTube videos (which come with their own privacy policy etc.) and Stripe for payment processing.
    If you pay for a subscription, you will see a link to Stripe's policies on the bottom of the page.
    These apply to you and your data independently of what is written in this document, if you choose to subscribe to Premium.
